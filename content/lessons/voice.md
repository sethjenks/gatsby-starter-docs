##Who is Nav?
#####Nav is uncomplicated, modern, credible and committed.

The word root “nav” evokes both imagery and meaning around navigation, direction, progress, and exploration. We do not have to state or impart any of these meanings (i.e, We use the word “navigate” sparingly).

Nav is experiential, using proven methods by those who have lived it through real-world trial and error. And thus, nav is authentic and specific in our writing, avoiding generalities when possible.

In an industry that seems to enjoy talking to itself with ever increasing complexity, Nav simplifies. Nav synthesizes data into a straight, clear path forward.

##Our Voice and Tone
####(when speaking to customers or general public, adjusted for industry events or publications as needed).

Nav is confident, direct, optimistic and energetic.

We should speak in a way that excites small business owners to the possibilities of an easier way. We do this by using engaging, conversational language, with action verbs and humor when appropriate. Its should project a glimpse of smile.

Our messaging focuses on positivity and we strive to avoid using negative emotions, like fear, guilt and anxiety to sell stuff.

###Customer-centric.

#####Small business owners are short on time and typically in “survival mode.” We communicate what the benefit is for the audience and avoid cliche, fluff and limit the use of adjectives.

It’s not about us, it’s about them — the small business owner.When communicating, we take their POV. The small business owner is the hero of the story, and we’re just the helper. We bridge the gap and guide them to their goals.

We generally speak in the second person. Talk to our audience as if we’re face-to-face with them in their store, discussing topics that are on their mind. Say “you” and “your business” not “small businesses.”

We’re unafraid to insert our truth and opinion, even if it ruffles feathers. We earn trust this way–not by saying “we’re honest” but by consistently being confident, honest and correct in our communication.


#####Maintaining trust and credibility should supercede being entertaining.

 We can be snarky about small business financing industry–and its complexities and injustices–but should not be snarky about our audience’s lack of education.

 We communicate in a way that adds real value because it’s bringing something that people didn’t already know. It’s actionable and seamlessly connect to our product whenever possible.
