##Brand Story
It’s the one day you’ll never forget–the day you took the leap of faith to start your own business. Who knew it was possible to feel optimistic, excited and freaked out all at the same time? You’re really doing this. The dream is real.

Before long, though, your dream of starting a business collides with the reality of running and growing it. You bust your tail every waking hour, staying up late into the night trying to make the numbers work and praying enough customers “walk in the door.” It’s a constant hustle—but you’re hooked.

To start, you likely funded your business yourself—maybe with help from friends and family—but, soon that well runs dry. You look towards outside funding options, but the banks turn you down and online loan options seem crazy expensive. Nobody explains why or what you can do about it.

______

Business owners are experts in what they do, but they often struggle with the operations and finance end of running and growing their business. They didn’t start a business to manage their financial health. But, when ignored, it turns into a blindspot that makes them look risky to lenders and creditors, and as a result they can’t qualify for financing or only qualify for financing they cannot afford or should not take.

Some financial companies have taken advantage of this by introducing new financing options for small business. But, instead of improving the situation, it’s added to the complexity of understanding which option is right for their business. There are now 40+ different available ways to finance a business, and yet the small business death rate continues to stay steady at 600,000 on average each year.

**Nav is materially reducing the small business death rate in America by helping business owners understand and improve their credit and cash flow data, and streamlining access to the right credit products and services at the right time.**

We also help them protect their financial health and save their business money by monitoring their own credit profiles and managing risk by tracking the credit of their customers and competitors.

##What we do
**_(See [Appendix](#appendix) for More Details)._**

**We don’t work for the financial companies. We work for business owners by bringing transparency and guidance around the data that’s used to judge them.** Nav clearly shows what their unique, relevant financial data says about them, including the parts they may not want to hear. We help them fix the parts that are wrong, and show them how to make the parts that are correct look better. And since we are not controlled by financial institutions, we can steer business owners away from bad deals, and toward good ones.

We make recommendations via our experts, underlying data and technology. Whenever possible, we make it simple for the business owner to take action and “do it for them” if they desire. Ultimately, it is the business owner making the decision —we provide recommendations.

**Liberated**, business owners have one less thing to worry about and can confidently run and grow their business the way they want.

##Backstory
We were founded by small business owners who had continually faced the challenges of understanding business credit and accessing affordable financing. They have accessed business capital more than 30 times, have been declined dozens of times, and were able to grow seven successful businesses. During this time, they experienced the misery involved with trying to figure out the inner workings of financing and credit. One of the businesses they started reviewed and corrected credit disputes for thousands of small business owners–both consumer and commercial credit. They made it their mission to take the solutions they learned during this process, and develop a modern field guide and do-it-for-you interface to help others avoid the pitfalls of business finance.
