## Brand Story

It’s the one day you’ll never forget – the day you took the leap of faith to start your own business. Who knew it was possible to feel optimistic, excited and freaked out all at the same time? You’re really doing this. The dream is real.

Before long, though, your dream of starting a business collides with the reality of running and growing it. You bust your tail every waking hour, staying up late into the night trying to make the numbers work and praying enough customers walk in the door tomorrow. It’s a constant hustle—but you’re hooked.

To start, you likely funded your business yourself—maybe with help from friends and family—but, soon that well runs dry. You didn’t start a business to deal with the finances, but you see your success depends on it. Desperate for help, you look towards outside funding options. But the banks and even suppliers turn down your credit requests, and online loan options seem crazy expensive. Nobody explains why or what you can do about it.

Business owners are experts in what they do, but they often struggle with the operations and finance end of running and growing their business. It often turns into a blind spot that makes them look risky to lenders and creditors, and as a result they can’t qualify for financing or only qualify for financing they cannot afford or should not take.

When necessary, the colors can be reversed with the white logo on blue

When brand colors cannot be used, it’s okay to use the black logo on white.

## Imagery

Business owners are the core of our company. We use imagery to tell their stories. Our images are warm and human, like a friend that can help rather than another piece of software to learn.

###Stylistic Elements
####Human
Small business owners are the lifeblood of Nav. We feature them as often as possible.

####Texture
We use texture from natural materials to connect our digital imagery to the real world.

####Shapes
We use geometric shapes to frame textures and create a collage aesthetic

####Hand-drawn lines
Hand-drawn lines add a human, hand-crafted element to all our imagery.

###Image Hierarchy
Our brand images are organized into a system that is used throughout our products and marketing materials. This is to ensure that every image is stylistically consistent with our brand.

* Hero
* Scene
* Spot
* Glyph
* Icon

###Hero
Hero images are used to communicate a central message. They are the largest, boldest images on a page. Each hero image is created using one of our secondary palettes.

###Product Hero
Since small business owners are the heroes of our brand, we show them more often than we show our product. However, sometimes it’s necessary to use product imagery when referencing a specific feature or benefit.

###Scene
Scene images support key concepts. They are stylistically similar to hero images but not quite as bold. Each scene image is created using one of our secondary palettes.

###Product Scene
Scene images can also be used to showcase our product when necessary. We use a textured brush stoke to frame the device.

###Spots
Spot illustrations represent specific content. They can be literal or metaphorical as long as they closely relate to the subject matter.

Each spot illustration is created using one of our secondary palettes. All four colors from the chosen palette are used.

When several spots are used together on a page, they should all have the same color palette.

###Glyphs
Glyphs are small illustrations that represent a single concept. They are similar to spot illustrations but smaller and simpler.

Each glyph is created using one of our secondary palettes. However, only two colors from the chosen palette are used: dark blue and peach, dark green and gold, dark red and teal, or dark brown and lavender.

When several glyphs are used together on a page, they should all have the same color palette

###Icons
Icons are small, simple graphics that help organize content. They are used like bullet points or for navigation.
